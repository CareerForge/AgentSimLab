# AgentSimLab

Contains minimal, working stubs that demonstrate:
- a deterministic Kernel using an isolated RNG
- simple Agent API
- snapshot / restore mechanism
- basic network, logger, runner, and tests
This scaffold is intended to be extended into the full-featured simulator described in the design docs.
